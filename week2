Great! Let’s move on to **Week 2** of your React development roadmap. This week, you’ll **build on your basics** by creating simple interactive web pages using JavaScript, then **get comfortable with TypeScript** and how it connects with modern front-end tools like **Webpack**. The goal is to start preparing for setting up a React project in Week 3.

### **🔤 Day 3–4: Deeper Dive into TypeScript**

**Topics:**

* Basic types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `any`
* Interfaces and object typing
* Function return types
* Type aliases and union types

**Do This:**

* [ ] Convert your To-Do app logic to TypeScript (in VS Code)
* [ ] Practice writing small functions using TypeScript

**Learn From:**

* [TS Handbook – Basic Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)

### **📦 Day 5–6: Introduction to Webpack**

**Topics:**

* What is Webpack? Why do we need it?
* Entry point, output, loaders, plugins
* Babel for converting modern JS/TS to browser-compatible code

**Do This:**

* [ ] Create a basic Webpack config file from scratch
* [ ] Bundle a small project with Webpack (even just a Hello World)

**Learn From:**

* [Webpack 5 Crash Course – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs)
* [Webpack Official Guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)

### **🧠 Day 7: Review + Mini Project**

**Mini Project Idea:**
✅ Build a **Tip Calculator App** with:

* HTML form (bill amount + tip %)
* JavaScript/TypeScript to calculate the result
* Styled with CSS
* Bundle it using Webpack

---

### 📝 Week 2 Review Checklist

* [ ] I can write JavaScript that interacts with the DOM and handles events.
* [ ] I understand the difference between JavaScript and TypeScript.
* [ ] I can use TypeScript to define types and functions.
* [ ] I have created a basic Webpack setup for bundling code.
